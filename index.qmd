This book is intended to offer practical, step-by-step instructions to solve common problems when doing data analysis for Personal Science. 

# Prerequisites

We'll assume some basic tools.

-   A spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel
-   The programming language R and the associated development environment RStudio

A good introduction to R is [Hands On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

## R Packages

Nearly all of the examples in this book will use the following packages, each of which is probably already familiar if you've done some basic R programming already.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(kableExtra)


```

In addition, specific solutions may require other packages that will be identified in the instructions.


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
