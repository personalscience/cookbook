## Handling microbiome data

We do three microbiome tests.

Note that most tests report the *relative* abundance of a particular microbe. But that number is computed, based on the *absolute* number of material found in the sample, which can vary widely from sample to sample.

Here's our result for our first test:

| Test 1  |          |          |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Microbe | Absolute | Relative | Change |
| A       | 100      | 10%      | 0%     |
| B       | 500      | 50%      | 0%     |
| C       | 400      | 40%      | 0%     |
| D       | 0        | 0%       |        |
|         |          |          |        |
| Total   | 1000     | 100%     | 0%     |



We don't specify the units in the "Absolute" column, but it can be whatever you like.  In this simple example, we measure a total of 1000 (of something) and compute the various relative amounts. All is well.

Our second test, for whatever reason, collect a lot more stuff, leading to a larger *absolute* amount but the relative amounts are unchanged.

| Test 2  |          |          |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Microbe | Absolute | Relative | Change |
| A       | 150      | 10%      | 0%     |
| B       | 750      | 50%      | 0%     |
| C       | 600      | 40%      | 0%     |
| D       | 0        | 0%       | 0%     |
|         |          |          |        |
| Total   | 1500     | 100%     | 0%     |



But now consider a different case. This time, for some reason one of the three microbes has a massive increase. Importantly, *none of the other microbes changed*.  This might happen if your sample were somehow contaminated, for example, perhaps from some extraneous microbe entering the tube after you sampled it. Or it could be that the sampling site suddenly had a new growth of an insert microbe that doesn't affect anything else.  Lots of reasons could explain why the *absolute* values of various microbes could be unchanged yet the *relative* values could be substantially different.

| Test 3A |          |          |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Microbe | Absolute | Relative | Change |
| A       | 150      | 8%       | -3%    |
| B       | 750      | 38%      | -13%   |
| C       | 600      | 30%      | -10%   |
| D       | 500      | 25%      | 25%    |
|         |          |          |        |
| Total   | 2000     | 100%     | 0%     |



But you don't need contamination for a slight change in one microbe to have a major impact on the *relative* abundance of the others.

Watch what happens when two microbes, A and B, are unchanged while two others swap abundance amounts.


| Test 3B |          |          |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Microbe | Absolute | Relative | Change |
| A       | 150      | 8%       | -3%    |
| B       | 750      | 38%      | -13%   |
| C       | 700      | 35%      | -5%    |
| D       | 400      | 20%      | 20%    |
|         |          |          |        |
| Total   | 2000     | 100%     | 0%     |

A and B appear to have the same relative abundances 


Microbes exist in an *ecology*. They're not independent of one another. Often an increase or decrease in one will drive a corresponding change in another.  

Consider the interesting case where one one microbe (A) doubles in abundance, causing another (B) to halve. Although the changes are directly related to one another, it's hard to see that in the type of relative summary in most reports.

| Test 2B |          |          |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Microbe | Absolute | Relative | Change |
| A       | 200      | 24%      | 14%    |
| B       | 250      | 29%      | -21%   |
| C       | 400      | 47%      | 7%     |
| D       | 0        | 0%       | 0%     |
|         |          |          |        |
| Total   | 850      | 100%     | 0%     |

In 2B, a major change happened -- the abundance of one microbe (A) exploded and caused another (B) to plunge. Although another, independent microbe (C) was completely unaffected by this change, when we look only at the relative differences, we might be fooled into thinking that C changed as well.

### Bottom line

It's very hard to make judgements one way or another from simple comparisons of relative abundance changes from one sample to another.  Too many factors determine the measured levels of the various microbes. 

Despite this, we know empirically that the overall relative abundances are reasonably stable from one collection to another. Not precisely stable, but at least at the highest, say, phylum levels, the abundances track fairly consistently from day to day. In the oral microbiome, for example, *Streptococcus* is almost always the lead phylum, with *Neissaria* and *Rothia* competing with a few others for second or third place.

Meanwhile, in larger population studies of say thousands of people sampled multiple times, some significant patterns emerge of microbes that are consistently over- or under-represented in various disease states.
